# Structify Take Home Challenge
Take home problem for structify

This algorithm works by first preprocessing all pairs of chords and pairing them up by their ID in a dict (could've been a list of tuples but I used a dict for debugging's sake initially). The pairs of radian points on the circle together compose a singular chord in our circle. The code then loops through all chords without redundantly checking them, identifies whether the chord crosses the 0 radian or not, and then checks whether the start/end of 1 chord is in between the other and vice versa to see if these chords truly intersect. This is just counted over all pair iterations of chords in the circle. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^2) due to their being N(N-1)/2 comparisons of chords made which simplifies to running in N^2 time. The space complexity is O(N) since we hold all chords in a dictionary to pair them up. Maybe using a tree could reduce our time complexity down to O(NlogN) by reducing the number of comparisons. To run the code, simply run the script - test cases are provided and cover a few edge cases not nullified by the constraints of the problem.
